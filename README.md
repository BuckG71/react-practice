# Application Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and starting the application. This application is built with Node.js for the backend, potentially using a framework like Express, and connects to a PostgreSQL database. Please ensure you have basic knowledge of these technologies and have them installed on your system before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Git (optional, recommended for cloning the repository)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)

You can clone this project using Git. Otherwise, you can download the project files directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuckG71/react-practice.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory (this will depend on your specific file path, generic path shown below) and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
npm install
```

### 3. Setup PostgreSQL Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system. Create a new database for the application.

```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name; # i named my database 'todolist' 
\q
```

Configure your database connection settings in `db.js` or through environment variables, depending on how the application is set up.

#### Environment Variables Setup

During the setup and connection of your database, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store environment variables for your application. This file should include the following variables:

```
DB_USER=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=todolist
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=
```

Environment variables are essential for configuring your application without hardcoding sensitive information directly into your codebase. To learn more about creating and using environment variables, please refer to this [resource on environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html).

### 4. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend directory if it's separate from the frontend. Install any dependencies if you haven't already, and start the server.

```bash
cd backend # If your backend is in a separate directory
npm install # If you haven't installed backend dependencies
node index.js
```

Alternatively, if your project is set up to use npm scripts defined in `package.json`, you might be able to start your server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will compile the backend and start it. If it doesn't start automatically, you can manually navigate to the specified host and port in your browser, usually `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can use it by interacting with the UI in your web browser. The application should be connected to the PostgreSQL database, allowing you to perform operations as designed.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed and up to date.
- Check that the PostgreSQL service is running before attempting to connect.
- Verify that your database connection settings are correct in `db.js` or your environment variables.
- If you encounter errors during `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
